## Loops

- used to iterate over things
- we have iterable objects or data and we run the loop for every item in that collection

---

## While Loop

- runs as long as a value is truthy
- conditional statement run only once if a condition is true but this keep running as long as the condition doesn't become falsy
- BE CAREFUL AND DON'T YOU DARE CREATE AN ENDLESS LOOP
