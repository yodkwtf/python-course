- We can make HTTP requests with python too
- There are a bunch of packages to help with that and we have used one called `requests`

#### Headers

- Meta data that tell what type of data is expected
- We can use them with get requests to specify what kind of data we want from an API (json, html, etc.)

#### Query Strings

- A way to pass data to server as part of GET request
- Comprises of key value pairs - `https://yodkwtf.com/?key1=value1&key2=value2`
- Additional info passed with the request
- We can have as many query strings as we want
