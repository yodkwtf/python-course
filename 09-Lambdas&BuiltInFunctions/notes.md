## Lambdas

- lambdas are single line functions that have no name
- sometimes are called anonymous functions
- only has a single expression w/o the return keyword
- the result can be stored in a variable but not so common use

  ```py
  add = lambda a, b: a + b

  print(add(3,10)) # 13
  ```

- they are not used that much
