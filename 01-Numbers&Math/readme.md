## Numbers and Math

- `float` uses more space than `int`
- There is only 2 no. b.w 0-1 but there are infinite nos. b/w 0.0 and 1.0
- Adding `int` and `float` always returns `float`
- Use `type()` func to check the type

---

- `1/2` will return a float `0.5` but a lot of other lang ignore the decimal and don't use float
- Operators follow the hierarchy rule called PEMDAS or BODMAS

---

- `4**3` = `4*4*4`
- `49**0.5` = `7` as it takes the sqrt
- `25%4` = 1 -> it gives remainder and used to find if num is even or odd
- `10/3` = 3.3333333 -> returns a float
- `10//3` = 3 -> returns just an int
