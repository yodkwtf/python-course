## Input Function

- Gets an input from users
- Built-in function
- Result is always a string
- a msg can be passed inside for the user

---

## Conditional Statements (If-Else)

- use `if-else` statements to make the program do different things based on some logic/condition
- we can do a lot more than just print stuff inside `if-else`
- we can avoid elif and else statements too based on our needs
- we will only have one `if` and one `else` but we can have as many `elif`'s as we want

##### Truthiness and Falseness

- All conditionals resolve True or False
- False values are - empty objects, empty strings, None, and zero
