## Variables

- Store values/data to access them later
- They can store all sorts of data types
- They need to be assigned before they can be used
- Variables can be assigned to other variables
  ```bash
   a = 10
   b = a
  ```
- Can be reassigned at any time
  ```bash
  a = 10
  a = 50
  ```
- Can be assigned at the same time as other variables
  ```bash
    a, b, c = 10, 25, 50
  ```

##### Rules for naming Variables

- have to start with letter or underscore only
- name must contain letters, numbers, or underscores
- names are case sensitive

##### Naming Conventions for Variables

- should be named using snake_case
- usually should be lowercase
- CAPITAL_CAME_CASE refers to constants like pi(3.14)
- UpperCamelCase refers to classes
- variables with double underscore should be left alone and shouldn't be messed with - `__no_touch__`
